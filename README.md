# My Portfolio 🌐

Welcome to my personal portfolio website — a living showcase of my work, skills, and projects.  
Whenever I update or add a project, it will appear here automatically.

## 🔎 About Me

I’m a software developer / embedded-systems / full-stack / [your domain here] (or whatever you prefer), passionate about building robust solutions, learning new technologies, and sharing my work.  
This portfolio acts as a centralized place to display my projects, skills, and experience.

## 🚀 What’s This Repository

This repo powers the website you are currently viewing.  
- All project listings, descriptions and links (live demos / code repos) are auto-rendered via the site generator.  
- You can update, add or remove project entries — the site will reflect those changes immediately.  
- Ideal as a “single place” to show everything: portfolio, project links, résumé, and more — without maintaining multiple scattered resources.

## 🎛️ Tech / Stack / What I Use

- Primary languages / frameworks / tools: _e.g._ JavaScript / HTML / CSS / React / Flutter / Embedded C / PostgreSQL / … (or whatever you use)

## ✅ Why This Setup

- Clean, centralized presence: Instead of scattered GitHub repos and inconsistent README formats, this site gives a unified view.  
- Easy updates: As you grow and add more projects, you don’t need to update multiple places.  
- Professional visibility: Great for sharing with employers & collaborators — they see all your work in one place.  
- Flexibility: You can add blog posts, contact info, résumé/CV, or any additional sections later as needed.
